# Code-a-thon Project Template

This project is intended to help you apply your skills in R in a way that would be conducive for collaborating or creating reproducible analyses.


## Data Used

Identify a dataset to analyze. Remember that if you share the data you must **not violate any privacy restrictions**

If you don't have your own data, options for places to find data are listed on https://daseh.org.

You might start by setting up an R Project, importing your data, previewing the data, etc. 

This dataset tracks the updates made on the dataset "COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Crosswalk - Rank Ordered by Score"


```{r}


COVID_19_Community_Vulnerability_Crosswalk_Rank_Ordered_by_Score_ <- read_csv("C:/Users/lucym/Downloads/COVID-19_Community_Vulnerability_Crosswalk_-_Rank_Ordered_by_Score_.csv")

covid_19_ranked_by_score <- COVID_19_Community_Vulnerability_Crosswalk_Rank_Ordered_by_Score_
covid_19_ranked_by_score

#rename columns hardest hit area,   `Low Income Area (LIA) Census Tract (Poverty Percentage)`, 



```

**describe** what your data looks like and **where** you got it. Identify what the variables and samples are, or point to a data dictionary. Describe how the data was originally created. 

Data from healthcare.gov- COVID-19 community vulnerability crosswalk (ordered by score)

Looks at communities down to the census track based of four key datasets
Hardest hit area (HHA)
Low income area (LIA)
Tribal community 
Rural community 






# Data Cleaning/Wrangling

Perform any data subsetting, cleaning, or manipulation methods that were described in this course on your data. Examples are: renaming the columns, recoding values, reshaping the data, filtering the data etc. 

You might also research other methods to include here, especially if your data is very unique.

```{r}

#looked at the different variables 

rename_covid_19 <- rename(covid_19_ranked_by_score, 
"State" = STATE,
"Low_Income_Census_Tract" = 'Low Income Area (LIA) Census Tract (Poverty Percentage)',
"Hardest_hit_area" = 'Hardest Hit Area (HHA)',
)


covid_19_ranked_by_score <- rename_covid_19

#select(covid_19_ranked_by_score, State, County)
     
    # County, Max Possible Score, Hardest_hit_area, HHA,  Low_Income_Census_Tract)




```

```{r}
select(covid_19_ranked_by_score, State, Hardest_hit_area, Low_Income_Census_Tract)
```

# Data Visualization

Create some visualizations of your data using the esquisse app or the ggplot2 package.

```{r}






```


# Data Analysis

Perform a **simple analysis** of your data. This can involve summarizing the data to describe aspects about it (quartiles, means, range etc.) or a simple statistical test. 

Don't forget to describe what analysis you performed and why. Provide some simple **interpretation** about what your analysis might indicate about your data.

```{r}

```


# Please include additional sections as desired.

```{r}

```


# Versions

Include some information about the version of R and the packages you are using by running sessionInfo().

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
